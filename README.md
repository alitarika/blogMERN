# Blog (MERN stack)

[Live Link](https://blog-mern-sable.vercel.app/)

I developed a blog website as I deemed a good exercise for a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project. I specifically focused on and set up a robust backend, utilizing Expres.js and MongoDB for data storage. Gained a valuable experience in implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, user authentication and deploying applications, overall enhancing my proficiency as a web developer.
